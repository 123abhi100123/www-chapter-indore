Introducing Speakers & their Topics :-

Blind SQL Injection :- Blind SQL injection is a type of SQL Injection attack that asks the database true or false questions and determines the answer based on the applications response. This attack is often used when the web application is configured to show generic error messages, but has not mitigated the code that is vulnerable to SQL injection.

Intro of Speaker :- Ansh Bhawnani is independent Security Researcher and Hackfluencer.

Unrestricted File Upload :- Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step.

Intro of Speaker :-

Raju Kumar is currently Synack Red Team member. He has participated in many bug bounties program & Recognised by many Companies likeDell, Mastercard, Netgear, DigitalOcean , Western Union, Genymotion and many more for finding a critical vulnerability in their website.
